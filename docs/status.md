## Project summary

<!--
A short paragraph outlining the main idea of the project (see further
instructions here: https://royf.org/crs/CS175/W26/proposal.pdf). You now have
a better sense of what your project is about than you did in the proposal, so update and clarify
beyond that version. Do not change your proposal.md page unless you completely changed
your topic since your proposal.
-->

## Approach

<!--
Give a detailed description of your approach, in a few of paragraphs (at least a
couple). You should summarize the main method you are using, such as by overviewing the
structure of its data, how it samples that data, and the equations of the loss(es) it optimizes
(you can copy this information from scientific publications or online resources, in which case
cite them clearly. The default GitHub Pages we previously shared includes an example of
redering math within Markdown). You should also provide details about the approach as it
applies to your scenario, such as how you set up inputs and outputs (e.g. states / observations,
actions, and rewards), how much data you use (e.g. for how many interaction steps you train),
and the values of any hyperparameters (cite your source for default hyperparameter values,
and for any changed values detail if and how you tune them and the numbers you end up
using). A good guideline is to incorporate sufficient details so that most of your approach is
reproducible by a reader. You’re encouraged to use figures and tables for this, as appropriate,
e.g. as we used in the exercises
-->

## Evaluation

<!--
An important aspect of your project, as we mentioned in the beginning, is
evaluating your project. Be clear and precise about describing the evaluation setup, for both
quantitative and qualitative results. Present the results to convince the reader that you have a
working implementation. Use plots, charts, tables, screenshots, figures, etc. as appropriate.
For each type of evaluation that you perform, you’ll probably need at least 1 or 2 paragraphs
(excluding figures etc.) to describe it.
-->

## Remaining Goals and Challenges

<!--
In a couple of paragraphs, describe your goals for the
remainder of the quarter. At the very least, describe in what ways your current prototype is
more limited than your final goal, and what you want to add to make it a complete contribution.
Note that if you think your method is working well enough, but have not performed sufficient
evaluation to gain insight, doing this should be a goal. Similarly, you may propose comparing
with other methods / approaches / manually tailored solutions (when feasible) that you did not
get a chance to implement, but can enrich your discussion in the final report. Finally, given
your experience so far, describe some of the challenges you anticipate facing by the time your
final report is due, to what degree you expect them to become roadblocking obstacles, and
what you might try in order to overcome them.
-->

## Resources Used

<!--
Mention all the resources that you found useful in implementing your
method, experiments, and analysis. This should include everything like code documentation,
AI/ML libraries, source code that you used, StackOverflow, etc. You do not have to include
every tiny (or commonplace) thing you used, but it is important to report the sources that are
crucial to your project. One aspect that does need to be comprehensive is a description of any
use you made of AI tools.
