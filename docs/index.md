## Outline

Our project aims to build a real-time wolf detection system for Minecraft that locates wolves in a live gameplay environment. Using automatically generated in-game visual data and labeled 2D coordinates, the model learns to identify wolves from automatically generated screenshots. The result is a fast, gameplay-ready detector that gives players fast visual awareness of wolves in their world.
